{{sp[info] Objective 14.1a}} · *workout* A reaction $\ce{A <=> B}$ has $k_f = 0.36\ \text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_r = 0.12\ \text{s}^{-1}$. Calculate $K$ and state which side is favored at equilibrium.
:::
::: tab Answer
$$K=\frac{k_f}{k_r}=\frac{0.36}{0.12}=3.0$$

Since $K>1$, the equilibrium favors the product side (B).

{{sp[info] Objective 14.1a}} · *workout* A reaction $\ce{A(g) <=> 3B(g)}$ has $K_c=0.10$ at 298 K. What is $K_c$ for the reverse reaction, $\ce{3B(g) <=> A(g)}$, at the same temperature?
:::
::: tab Answer
Reversing a reaction inverts $K$: $K_c(\text{reverse}) = 1/0.10 = 10$.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.1a}} · *short answer* A sealed flask of $\ce{N2O4}$ and $\ce{NO2}$ sits at equilibrium. A student adds a trace of $\ce{NO2}$ made from nitrogen-15 and, hours later, finds $^{15}\ce{N}$ distributed through both species. Explain what this shows.
:::
::: tab Answer
It shows that **equilibrium is dynamic, not static** — and it is one of the few experiments that demonstrate this directly.

If the reaction had genuinely stopped, the labeled nitrogen would still be sitting in $\ce{NO2}$ where it was placed. Instead it has been scrambled between both species, which can only happen if $\ce{NO2}$ molecules are continuously converting to $\ce{N2O4}$ and back.

**What did not change:** the *concentrations* of $\ce{N2O4}$ and $\ce{NO2}$ were constant throughout, because the forward and reverse reactions proceed at equal rates. Nothing an ordinary instrument measures would have moved.

**Why this matters beyond the demonstration:** isotope scrambling is the standard way to prove that a system which *looks* inert is genuinely at equilibrium rather than kinetically stuck. A hydrogen-oxygen mixture at room temperature would show no scrambling at all — it is not at equilibrium, merely too slow to react.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.1b}} · *short answer* A reaction has $K = 4.8\times10^{-11}$. A student concludes the reaction "does not happen at all." Is this an accurate description? Explain, connecting back to Chapter 13.
:::
::: tab Answer
Not quite accurate. $K$ describes the equilibrium *position* — with $K$ this small, essentially no product is present at equilibrium, so the reaction proceeds hardly at all in the forward direction. But this says nothing about *rate*: a reaction can also be slow for kinetic reasons (a large activation energy, Chapter 13) independent of how small or large $K$ is. "Doesn't happen" conflates a strongly reactant-favored equilibrium with a reaction that is intrinsically slow — they are related but distinct ideas.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.1b}} · *short answer* At 25 °C the reaction $\ce{H2(g) + Cl2(g) <=> 2HCl(g)}$ has $K = 4.4\times10^{32}$, while $\ce{N2(g) + 3H2(g) <=> 2NH3(g)}$ has $K = 6.0\times10^{5}$. Both are described as "product-favored." Is that description equally useful for both? What practical difference does the size gap make?
:::
::: tab Answer
Both have $K > 1$, so both do favor products — but the two numbers describe very different situations, and treating them as the same loses information that matters.

**$K = 4.4\times10^{32}$ is effectively irreversible.** At equilibrium the amount of unreacted $\ce{H2}$ and $\ce{Cl2}$ is so small as to be undetectable. For any practical purpose the reaction goes to completion, and an ICE table would return $x$ equal to the limiting reactant's entire initial amount.

**$K = 6.0\times10^{5}$ is large but genuinely finite.** Products dominate, yet a measurable quantity of $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{H2}$ remains, and — crucially — that remainder can be pushed further by the stresses in §14.5. There is something left to optimize.

**The practical difference.** Nobody engineers the pressure of an HCl synthesis to improve its yield; the yield is already 100% for all purposes. Ammonia synthesis is engineered obsessively — high pressure, product removal, recycle loops — precisely because $6.0\times10^{5}$ leaves room to gain.

**And neither number says anything about rate.** The ammonia reaction, despite its favorable $K$, requires a catalyst and 450 °C to proceed at all.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.1b}} · *multiple-choice* A reaction has $K = 3\times10^{25}$ at 25 °C, yet no product forms when the reactants are mixed and left on the bench for a week. Which statement is correct?

(A) The reported value of $K$ must be wrong
(B) The reaction is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically slow — it has a large activation energy
\(C) $K$ must actually be small at 25 °C
(D) The mixture has already reached equilibrium
:::
::: tab Answer
**(B).** $K$ and rate are set by two different quantities and are logically independent. $K$ is fixed by the energy difference between reactants and products; the rate is fixed by the height of the barrier between them (Chapter 13). A reaction can have an enormous $K$ and a barrier so high that nothing measurable happens at room temperature.

**Why the others fail:**
- **(A)** Nothing observed contradicts $K$. $K$ predicts where the system ends up, not when it gets there.
- **\(C)** The problem states $K = 3\times10^{25}$ *at 25 °C* — that is already the value at the relevant temperature.
- **(D)** A system at equilibrium with $K = 3\times10^{25}$ would be essentially pure product. This flask is essentially pure reactant, which is as far from equilibrium as it is possible to be.

**The canonical case:** hydrogen and oxygen have $K \approx 10^{41}$ for forming water and will sit unchanged indefinitely — until a spark supplies the activation energy.

A. The reaction is endothermic.
B. The partial pressure of NO(g) is less at 2500 K than at 2200 K.
C. $K_p$ is less than $K_c$ by a factor of (RT).
D. The total pressure at 2200 K is the same as at 2500 K.
E. Higher total pressure shifts the equilibrium to the left.
:::
::: tab Answer
**A.** $K_p$ increases as temperature increases, which by Le Chatelier's principle means raising temperature favors the (already-favored) forward direction — true only if the forward reaction is endothermic. (For B: a larger K at higher T means more NO forms, the opposite of B. For C: since $\Delta n = 2-(1+1)=0$ here, $K_p=K_c$ exactly — C is false. For D and E: this reaction's total moles of gas don't change, $\Delta n=0$, so pressure/volume changes don't shift this particular equilibrium at all.)

{{sp[info] Objective 14.2a}} · *workout* For $\ce{2SO2(g) + O2(g) <=> 2SO3(g)}$ at 1000 K, $K_p = 3.4$. Calculate $K_c$.
:::
::: tab Answer
Count gas moles: 2 on the right, $2 + 1 = 3$ on the left, so $\Delta n = 2 - 3 = -1$.

Rearrange $K_p = K_c(RT)^{\Delta n}$ for $K_c$:

$$K_c = K_p(RT)^{-\Delta n} = 3.4\times(0.0821\times1000)^{+1} = 3.4\times82.1 = 2.8\times10^{2}$$

**Check the direction before trusting the number.** $\Delta n$ is negative — fewer gas molecules on the product side — so $K_c$ should come out *larger* than $K_p$, and it does, 280 versus 3.4. Had it come out smaller, the exponent's sign was applied backwards.

{{sp[warning] Which R}} Use $R = 0.0821\ \text{L·atm·mol}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1}$, not 8.314 — the gas-constant value must match the pressure units $K_p$ is expressed in.

:::

$\ce{NH4CO2NH2}$ is a pure solid and is omitted:

{{sp[info] Objective 14.2b}} · *short answer* A student writes the equilibrium expression for $\ce{HF(aq) + H2O(l) <=> F-(aq) + H3O+(aq)}$ as $K_c=\dfrac{[\ce{F-}][\ce{H3O+}]}{[\ce{HF}][\ce{H2O}]}$. Is this the conventional final form? If not, what is?
:::
::: tab Answer
Not the conventional final form. Water is the solvent, present in large excess with a nearly constant concentration, so it is absorbed into the equilibrium constant rather than written explicitly: $K_c=\dfrac{[\ce{F-}][\ce{H3O+}]}{[\ce{HF}]}$.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.2b}} · *short answer* A student writes the expression for $\ce{Fe3O4(s) + 4H2(g) <=> 3Fe(s) + 4H2O(g)}$ as $K_c = \dfrac{[\ce{Fe}]^3[\ce{H2O}]^4}{[\ce{Fe3O4}][\ce{H2}]^4}$. Correct it and explain the error.
:::
::: tab Answer
**The correct expression:**

$$K_c = \frac{[\ce{H2O}]^4}{[\ce{H2}]^4}$$

**The error:** $\ce{Fe3O4}$ and $\ce{Fe}$ are both **pure solids**, and pure solids are omitted.

**Why they are omitted.** A pure solid's "concentration" is its density divided by its molar mass — a property of the substance, not of how much is present. Grinding up more iron does not make the iron more concentrated. Being constant, the quantity is folded into $K$ rather than written as a variable.

**The observable consequence, which is the real point:** adding more $\ce{Fe3O4}$ does not shift this equilibrium at all. The ratio $[\ce{H2O}]/[\ce{H2}]$ is fixed by temperature alone. If the student's expression were right, adding solid would change the gas composition — and it does not.

**A useful cross-check:** any species you could add a spoonful of without changing the answer does not belong in $K$.

Reaction 3 = reaction 1 − reaction 2 (subtracting reaction 2 is the same as adding its reverse, whose K is $1/K_2$):

:::
::: tab Answer
Three operations, applied in order — and the order does not matter as long as each is applied correctly.

**Step 1 — add the two given reactions.** Summing them cancels $\ce{2NO}$:

$$\ce{N2 + 2O2 <=> 2NO2} \qquad K_3 = K_1K_2 = (4.1\times10^{-31})(6.4\times10^{9}) = 2.6\times10^{-21}$$

**Step 2 — reverse it**, since the target has $\ce{NO2}$ on the left:

$$\ce{2NO2 <=> N2 + 2O2} \qquad K_4 = \frac{1}{2.6\times10^{-21}} = 3.8\times10^{20}$$

**Step 3 — halve every coefficient**, which takes the square root:

$$\ce{NO2 <=> 1/2N2 + O2} \qquad K = \sqrt{3.8\times10^{20}} = 2.0\times10^{10}$$

**Handling the exponent by hand:** $\sqrt{3.8\times10^{20}} = \sqrt{3.8}\times10^{10} = 1.95\times10^{10}$. Square roots of powers of ten are easiest when the exponent is even — if it is odd, shift the decimal first, e.g. $\sqrt{3.8\times10^{21}} = \sqrt{38\times10^{20}} = 6.2\times10^{10}$.

**Summary of the three rules used:**

| Operation | Effect on $K$ |
|---|---|
| add reactions | multiply the $K$'s |
| reverse | reciprocal |
| multiply coefficients by $n$ | raise to the $n$th power ($n = \tfrac12$ here) |

{{sp[info] Objective 14.2c}} · *workout* Given $\ce{SO2(g) + 1/2O2(g) <=> SO3(g)}$ with $K_1 = 20.$, find $K$ for (a) $\ce{2SO2(g) + O2(g) <=> 2SO3(g)}$ and (b) $\ce{2SO3(g) <=> 2SO2(g) + O2(g)}$.
:::
::: tab Answer
**(a) Doubling every coefficient squares $K$:**

$$K = (K_1)^2 = (20.)^2 = 4.0\times10^{2}$$

**(b) This is the reverse of (a), so take the reciprocal of (a)'s answer:**

$$K = \frac{1}{4.0\times10^{2}} = 2.5\times10^{-3}$$

**Why doubling squares rather than doubles.** Doubling the coefficients doubles every exponent, and doubling an exponent squares the whole quantity:

$$\frac{[\ce{SO3}]^2}{[\ce{SO2}]^2[\ce{O2}]} = \left(\frac{[\ce{SO3}]}{[\ce{SO2}][\ce{O2}]^{1/2}}\right)^2$$

{{sp[warning] Order does not matter; the operation does}} Doing (b) as "reverse first, then double" gives $(1/20.)^2 = 2.5\times10^{-3}$ — the same answer. What goes wrong is mixing the operations up, for instance writing $2\times20. = 40$. **Reversing takes a reciprocal; scaling takes a power; neither ever adds to or multiplies $K$ by the coefficient.**

Convert to concentrations: $[\ce{N2}]=0.351/3.75=0.0936$ M, $[\ce{H2}]=0.267/3.75=0.0712$ M, $[\ce{NH3}]=8.51\times10^{-4}/3.75=2.27\times10^{-4}$ M.

$$Q_c=\frac{(2.27\times10^{-4})^2}{(0.0936)(0.0712)^3}=0.00152$$

:::
::: tab Answer
Since $Q_c>K_c$ (8.4 > 1.2), the system proceeds in **reverse** (right to left) — $\ce{NH3}$ concentration will *decrease* as it decomposes back into $\ce{N2}$ and $\ce{H2}$ until $Q_c$ falls to 1.2.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.3a}} · *workout* For $\ce{CO(g) + H2O(g) <=> CO2(g) + H2(g)}$, $K_c = 5.10$ at 700 K. A vessel contains $[\ce{CO}] = 0.15$ M, $[\ce{H2O}] = 0.25$ M, $[\ce{CO2}] = 0.42$ M, $[\ce{H2}] = 0.37$ M. Is it at equilibrium? If not, which way does it shift, and what happens to $[\ce{CO}]$?
:::
::: tab Answer
Compute $Q_c$ from the same expression as $K_c$, using the concentrations given:

$$Q_c = \frac{[\ce{CO2}][\ce{H2}]}{[\ce{CO}][\ce{H2O}]} = \frac{(0.42)(0.37)}{(0.15)(0.25)} = \frac{0.1554}{0.0375} = 4.14$$

$$Q_c = 4.14 < K_c = 5.10$$

**Not at equilibrium.** With $Q < K$ the product-to-reactant ratio is too small, so the system shifts **forward**, making more $\ce{CO2}$ and $\ce{H2}$ at the expense of $\ce{CO}$ and $\ce{H2O}$.

**$[\ce{CO}]$ therefore decreases.**

**A sense of scale:** $Q$ and $K$ are within about 20% of each other, so this mixture is close to equilibrium and the shift will be modest. A mixture at $Q = 0.01$ would shift the same *direction* but far further — $Q$ versus $K$ gives direction reliably and distance only roughly.

| Initial (M) | 1.00 | 0 | 0 |
| Change (M) | $-x$ | $+x$ | $+x$ |
| Equilibrium (M) | $1.00-x$ | $x$ | $x$ |

$$K_c = \frac{x^2}{1.00 - x} = 1.80$$

$K_c$ is not small, so no shortcut is available. Clear the denominator:

$$x^2 = 1.80 - 1.80x \quad\Rightarrow\quad x^2 + 1.80x - 1.80 = 0$$

$$x = \frac{-1.80 + \sqrt{(1.80)^2 + 4(1.80)}}{2} = \frac{-1.80 + \sqrt{10.44}}{2} = \frac{-1.80 + 3.231}{2} = 0.716$$

The other root is negative and is discarded — a negative $x$ would mean the reaction ran backwards from a flask containing no products at all.

$$[\ce{PCl5}] = 1.00 - 0.716 = 0.28\ \text{M} \qquad [\ce{PCl3}] = [\ce{Cl2}] = 0.72\ \text{M}$$

**Check:** $\dfrac{(0.716)^2}{0.284} = \dfrac{0.513}{0.284} = 1.80$ ✓

Note that 72% of the $\ce{PCl5}$ dissociated. With $K$ near 1 a large fraction reacts, and any small-$x$ assumption would have been badly wrong.

$$K_c = \frac{x^2}{(0.400-2x)^2} = 4.6\times10^{-9}$$

$K_c$ is tiny, so assume $2x \ll 0.400$ and approximate the denominator as $(0.400)^2 = 0.160$:

$$\frac{x^2}{0.160} = 4.6\times10^{-9} \quad\Rightarrow\quad x^2 = 7.36\times10^{-10} \quad\Rightarrow\quad x = 2.7\times10^{-5}$$

**Validate against what was actually subtracted**, which is $2x = 5.4\times10^{-5}$:

$$\frac{2x}{[\ce{HBr}]_0} = \frac{5.4\times10^{-5}}{0.400} = 0.014\% \ \ll 5\%$$

The approximation is excellent.

$$[\ce{HBr}] = 0.400\ \text{M} \qquad [\ce{H2}] = [\ce{Br2}] = 2.7\times10^{-5}\ \text{M}$$

{{sp[warning] Check what you subtracted, not x}} The change in $[\ce{HBr}]$ is $2x$ because of the coefficient 2. Validating against $x/0.400$ understates the error by a factor of two — harmless here, not always.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.4b}} · *short answer* Two problems use the same $K = 1.0\times10^{-3}$ for $\ce{X <=> Y + Z}$. In problem A, $[\ce{X}]_0 = 2.0$ M; in problem B, $[\ce{X}]_0 = 1.0\times10^{-3}$ M. Will the small-$x$ approximation work equally well in both? Explain without fully solving either.
:::
::: tab Answer
**No — it works in A and fails in B.** Validity depends on $K$ **relative to the initial concentration**, never on $K$ alone.

**Problem A.** Approximating gives $x \approx \sqrt{(1.0\times10^{-3})(2.0)} = 0.045$ M, which is 2.2% of 2.0 M — comfortably under 5%. Valid.

**Problem B.** Approximating gives $x \approx \sqrt{(1.0\times10^{-3})(1.0\times10^{-3})} = 1.0\times10^{-3}$ M — **100%** of the starting concentration. Not merely invalid: it claims every bit of X reacts, which this $K$ does not support.

**The pattern.** As the initial concentration falls, the *fraction* that reacts rises, so dilute solutions are exactly where the shortcut breaks. Compare $K$ against $[\ce{X}]_0$: when $[\ce{X}]_0$ is many times larger than $K$, the shortcut is safe; when they are comparable, it is not.

**The practical rule:** never decide from the look of $K$ alone. Do the approximation, then check the percentage — the check is what tells you whether to keep the answer.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.5a}} · *multiple-choice* $\ce{Cu(s) + H2O(g) <=> H2(g) + CuO(s)}$, $\Delta H^\circ = 2.0$ kJ/mol. Equilibrium can be shifted to favor the products by:

A. increasing the pressure by means of a moving piston at constant T.
B. decreasing the pressure by means of a moving piston at constant T.
C. decreasing the temperature at constant pressure.
D. increasing the temperature at constant pressure.
E. adding a catalyst.

**D.** $\Delta H^\circ>0$ means the forward reaction is endothermic; increasing temperature favors the endothermic direction, shifting toward products. (A/B: both sides have exactly 1 mole of gas, $\Delta n=0$, so pressure/volume changes don't shift this equilibrium at all. C: decreasing T would favor the exothermic — reverse — direction. E: a catalyst never shifts equilibrium.)

{{sp[info] Objective 14.5a}} · *short answer* In the uncatalyzed reaction $\ce{N2O4(g) <=> 2NO2(g)}$ at 373 K, equilibrium partial pressures are $P_{\ce{N2O4}}=0.377$ atm and $P_{\ce{NO2}}=1.56$ atm. If a catalyst were introduced, what would happen to these equilibrium pressures?
:::
::: tab Answer
Nothing would change at equilibrium — a catalyst speeds up how quickly equilibrium is reached (by lowering the activation energy for both the forward and reverse reactions equally) but does not shift the equilibrium position or change $K_p$. The equilibrium pressures $P_{\ce{N2O4}}=0.377$ atm and $P_{\ce{NO2}}=1.56$ atm would be exactly the same, just reached faster.

{{sp[info] Objective 14.5a}} · *short answer* Carbonated water holds the equilibrium $\ce{CO2(g) <=> CO2(aq)}$. Use Le Chatelier's principle to explain (a) why an opened bottle goes flat, and (b) why it goes flat faster when warm.
:::
::: tab Answer
**(a) Opening the bottle removes a reactant from the equilibrium.** A sealed bottle is pressurized with $\ce{CO2}$ gas above the liquid. Opening it lets that gas escape, dropping $P_{\ce{CO2}}$ nearly to zero.

The system shifts **left** — dissolved $\ce{CO2}$ leaves solution to replace the gas lost. But the gas keeps escaping into the room, so equilibrium is never re-established and the shift continues until essentially all the dissolved $\ce{CO2}$ is gone. That is flatness.

A second equilibrium follows along: $\ce{CO2(aq) + H2O(l) <=> H2CO3(aq)}$. As $\ce{CO2(aq)}$ depletes, carbonic acid decomposes to replace it, so the drink also becomes less acidic — it tastes different, not merely less fizzy.

**(b) Dissolving a gas is exothermic**, so heat is a product:

$$\ce{CO2(g) <=> CO2(aq)} + \text{heat}$$

Raising the temperature is like adding a product, so the equilibrium shifts **left**, toward the gas. Warm liquid holds less dissolved $\ce{CO2}$ at equilibrium *and* loses it faster, since the higher temperature speeds the escape as well. Position and rate move the same way here.

**The connection back to Chapter 12:** this is Henry's law and the temperature-dependence of gas solubility — now derivable rather than merely stated.

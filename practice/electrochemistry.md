Oxidation: $\ce{Ca -> Ca^2+ + 2e-}$. Reduction: $\ce{F2 + 2e- -> 2F-}$. Electrons already balanced (2 each):

Oxidation: $\ce{Fe -> Fe^3+ + 3e-}$.

Reduction (acidic form first): $\ce{MnO4- + 4H+ + 3e- -> MnO2 + 2H2O}$. Electrons already balanced (3 each):

$$\ce{Fe + MnO4- + 4H+ -> Fe^3+ + MnO2 + 2H2O}$$

Convert to basic (add 4 $\ce{OH-}$ to both sides, combine $\ce{H+ + OH- -> H2O}$, simplify):

{{sp[info] Objective 18.1b}} · *workout* Balance $\ce{MnO4- + Fe^2+ -> Mn^2+ + Fe^3+}$ in acidic solution.
:::
::: tab Answer
**Step 1 — split into half-reactions.**
$$\text{Oxidation: } \ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+} \qquad \text{Reduction: } \ce{MnO4- -> Mn^2+}$$

**Step 2 — non-O, non-H atoms already balance** (one Mn, one Fe each side).

**Step 3 — balance O with water, then H with $\ce{H+}$.** Four oxygens need four waters, hence eight hydrogens:
$$\ce{MnO4- -> Mn^2+ + 4H2O} \quad\Rightarrow\quad \ce{8H+ + MnO4- -> Mn^2+ + 4H2O}$$

**Step 4 — balance charge with electrons.** Left: $8(+1) + (-1) = +7$. Right: $+2$. Add five electrons to the left:
$$\ce{5e- + 8H+ + MnO4- -> Mn^2+ + 4H2O}$$
$$\ce{Fe^2+ -> Fe^3+ + e-}$$

**Step 5 — equalize electrons:** multiply the iron half-reaction by 5.
$$\ce{5Fe^2+ -> 5Fe^3+ + 5e-}$$

**Step 6 — add and cancel.**
$$\ce{8H+ + MnO4- + 5Fe^2+ -> Mn^2+ + 5Fe^3+ + 4H2O}$$

**Step 7 — verify.** Atoms: 8 H, 4 O, 1 Mn, 5 Fe on each side ✓. Charge: left $8(+1) + (-1) + 5(+2) = +17$; right $(+2) + 5(+3) = +17$ ✓

**Cross-check the electron count independently:** Mn goes from +7 in $\ce{MnO4-}$ to +2, a drop of 5 — matching the five electrons in step 4. If the two counts disagree, step 4 is where the error is.

**Why this reaction matters:** it is the basis of permanganate titration. $\ce{MnO4-}$ is deep purple and $\ce{Mn^2+}$ is nearly colorless, so the reaction is its own indicator — the first drop of excess permanganate turns the flask pink.

:::: tabs
::: tab Q 8
{{sp[info] Objective 18.2a}} · *short answer* Why does a galvanic cell need a salt bridge between its two half-cells?
:::
::: tab Answer
As the reaction proceeds, the anode's solution accumulates excess positive charge (cations form) and the cathode's solution loses positive charge (cations are consumed). The salt bridge lets ions flow between the half-cells to maintain electrical neutrality in both — without it, charge would build up and the reaction would quickly stop.
:::
::::

:::: tabs
::: tab Q 9
{{sp[info] Objective 18.2a}} · *short answer* Explain the role of the salt bridge in a galvanic cell. What happens if it is removed, and why can the two solutions not simply be mixed instead?
:::
::: tab Answer
**What it does.** As the cell operates, the anode compartment gains cations (zinc dissolving as $\ce{Zn^2+}$) and the cathode compartment loses them ($\ce{Cu^2+}$ plating out). Left alone, the anode side would build up positive charge and the cathode side negative charge within moments.

The salt bridge holds an inert electrolyte — $\ce{KNO3}$ or $\ce{KCl}$, chosen because neither ion reacts with anything present — and lets its ions migrate to cancel that buildup: **anions toward the anode, cations toward the cathode**.

**If it is removed, the current stops almost immediately.** Not because any reactant is exhausted, but because the charge separation creates an electric field opposing further electron flow. A cell with a broken salt bridge is a complete circuit electrically and a dead one chemically.

**Why the solutions cannot simply be mixed.** Mixing would let $\ce{Cu^2+}$ contact the zinc metal directly, and the electrons would transfer at the surface rather than through the wire. The reaction still happens — zinc still dissolves, copper still plates — but the energy is released entirely as **heat**, and no electrical work is extracted.

**That separation is the whole design principle.** A galvanic cell is not a way of making a reaction happen; the reaction would happen anyway. It is a way of forcing the electrons to take a long route, so their journey can be made to do something useful.

{{sp[info] Objective 18.3a}} · *short answer* Given these standard reduction potentials, identify the strongest oxidizing agent and the strongest reducing agent: $\ce{Al^3+ +3e- -> Al}$ (−1.66 V), $\ce{Fe^3+ +e- -> Fe^2+}$ (0.77 V), $\ce{Sn^4+ +2e- -> Sn^2+}$ (0.14 V), $\ce{AgBr+e- -> Ag+Br-}$ (0.07 V).
:::

::: tab Q 11
{{sp[info] Objective 18.3a}} · *multiple-choice* Why is the standard hydrogen electrode assigned a potential of exactly 0 V?

(A) Hydrogen has no tendency to gain or lose electrons
(B) It is an arbitrary reference point, chosen so that half-cell potentials can be tabulated
\(C) Its potential has been measured as 0 V to high precision
(D) Hydrogen is the lightest element
:::
::: tab Answer
**(B).** No half-cell potential can be measured on its own — a voltmeter has two leads and always reports a *difference*. Assigning one half-cell a value of zero fixes an origin, and every other potential is then quoted relative to it.

**Why the others fail:**
- **(A)** Hydrogen absolutely does have a tendency to gain or lose electrons; it oxidizes zinc and is reduced by fluorine. The 0 V says nothing about its reactivity.
- **\(C)** It was not measured. It was *defined*, exactly as sea level is defined as zero altitude.
- **(D)** Irrelevant. Hydrogen was chosen for practical reasons — it is easy to prepare reproducibly and involves a simple, fast half-reaction.

**The test that settles it.** Add 2.00 V to every entry in the table. All the tabulated numbers change; **no cell voltage changes at all**, because the shift cancels in $E^\circ_{cathode} - E^\circ_{anode}$. A quantity whose absolute value can be shifted freely without physical consequence is a convention, not a measurement.

::: tab Q 12
{{sp[info] Objective 18.3a}} · *short answer* Using $E^\circ$ values $\ce{Ag+/Ag} = +0.80$ V, $\ce{Cu^2+/Cu} = +0.34$ V, $\ce{Fe^2+/Fe} = -0.44$ V and $\ce{Mg^2+/Mg} = -2.37$ V, rank the four metals as reducing agents and the four cations as oxidizing agents. Then predict which metals dissolve in acid.
:::
::: tab Answer
The table is written as **reductions**, so it must be read in two directions.

**Cations as oxidizing agents — highest $E^\circ$ is strongest**, because a high reduction potential means the ion is easily reduced, which is exactly what an oxidizing agent does:

$$\ce{Ag+} > \ce{Cu^2+} > \ce{Fe^2+} > \ce{Mg^2+}$$

**Metals as reducing agents — lowest $E^\circ$ is strongest**, because a low reduction potential means the *metal* on the right-hand side gives up electrons readily:

$$\ce{Mg} > \ce{Fe} > \ce{Cu} > \ce{Ag}$$

**Note that the two rankings are exact reverses.** That is not a coincidence: a strong oxidizing agent's conjugate is a weak reducing agent, the same inverse pairing as acids and their conjugate bases in Chapter 15.

**Which dissolve in acid?** The relevant half-reaction is $\ce{2H+ + 2e- -> H2}$ at $E^\circ = 0$ V by definition. A metal reduces $\ce{H+}$ — that is, dissolves with hydrogen evolution — only if its own $E^\circ$ is **below** zero:

- **$\ce{Mg}$ (−2.37) and $\ce{Fe}$ (−0.44): dissolve**, vigorously and moderately respectively.
- **$\ce{Cu}$ (+0.34) and $\ce{Ag}$ (+0.80): do not**, which is why copper plumbing survives and silver coins do not fizz.

**The single rule that generates all of this:** a species will reduce anything **above** it in the $E^\circ$ table and will be oxidized by anything above it. Hydrogen at zero is simply one row among many — it looks special only because we put the origin there.

:::
::: tab Answer
Ag has the higher E° → cathode. Al → anode (reversed). Equalizing electrons (×3 for Ag):

$$\ce{Al(s) + 3Ag+(aq) -> Al^3+(aq) + 3Ag(s)}$$

$$\ce{Al(s)|Al^3+}(1\text{ M})||\ce{Ag+}(1\text{ M})|\ce{Ag(s)}$$

$$E^\circ_{cell}=0.80-(-1.66)=2.46\ \text{V}$$

Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ has the higher E° → cathode. Sn⁴⁺/Sn²⁺ → anode (reversed: $\ce{Sn^2+ -> Sn^4+ +2e-}$). Equalizing electrons (×2 for Fe):

$$\ce{2Fe^3+(aq) + Sn^2+(aq) -> 2Fe^2+(aq) + Sn^4+(aq)}$$

{{sp[info] Objective 18.3b}} · *workout* Given $\ce{Ni^2+ + 2e- -> Ni}$ ($E^\circ = -0.25$ V) and $\ce{Ag+ + e- -> Ag}$ ($E^\circ = +0.80$ V): identify the anode and cathode, write the balanced overall reaction and the cell diagram, and calculate $E^\circ_{cell}$.
:::
::: tab Answer
**Assign the electrodes.** Silver has the higher $E^\circ$, so silver is the **cathode** (reduced as written) and nickel is the **anode** (its half-reaction reverses to an oxidation).

$$\text{Cathode: } \ce{Ag+ + e- -> Ag} \qquad \text{Anode: } \ce{Ni -> Ni^2+ + 2e-}$$

**Balance the electrons.** Nickel releases two; silver accepts one. Multiply the silver half-reaction by 2:

$$\ce{Ni(s) + 2Ag+(aq) -> Ni^2+(aq) + 2Ag(s)}$$

**Cell diagram**, anode first:

$$\ce{Ni(s)|Ni^2+}(1\text{ M})||\ce{Ag+}(1\text{ M})|\ce{Ag(s)}$$

**Cell potential:**

$$E^\circ_{cell} = E^\circ_{cathode} - E^\circ_{anode} = 0.80 - (-0.25) = +1.05\ \text{V}$$

{{sp[warning] Do not double the silver potential}} The silver half-reaction was multiplied by 2 to balance electrons, but its $E^\circ$ stays +0.80 V. Potential is intensive — volts per electron. Using $2 \times 0.80 = 1.60$ would give $E^\circ_{cell} = 1.85$ V, which is wrong.

**Sanity check:** $E^\circ_{cell}$ came out positive, as it must whenever the higher-$E^\circ$ half-reaction is correctly assigned as the cathode. A negative result means the electrodes were swapped.

::: tab Answer
$$\Delta G^\circ=-nFE^\circ=-2(96{,}485)(0.63)=-1.22\times10^5\ \text{J/mol}=-122\ \text{kJ/mol}$$

$$K=e^{-\Delta G^\circ/RT}=e^{121{,}571/(8.314\times298)}=e^{49.1}\approx2.0\times10^{21}$$

A large negative $\Delta G^\circ$ and enormous $K$ — strongly product-favored, consistent with the substantial positive $E^\circ_{cell}$.

{{sp[info] Objective 18.4a}} · *workout* A cell has $E^\circ_{cell} = +0.46$ V with $n = 2$ at 298 K. Calculate $\Delta G^\circ$ and $K$.
:::
::: tab Answer
**$\Delta G^\circ$ from $E^\circ$:**

$$\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ = -(2)(96{,}485\ \text{C/mol})(0.46\ \text{V}) = -8.88\times10^{4}\ \text{J/mol} = -88.8\ \text{kJ/mol}$$

A coulomb-volt is a joule, so no unit conversion is needed on the way in — but the answer is in **joules**, and quoting it in kJ requires dividing by 1000.

**$K$ from $\Delta G^\circ$:**

$$K = e^{-\Delta G^\circ/RT} = e^{88{,}800/2478} = e^{35.8} = 3.6\times10^{15}$$

**All three signs agree**, as they must: $E^\circ > 0$, $\Delta G^\circ < 0$, $K \gg 1$ — a strongly product-favored reaction.

**The leverage worth internalizing.** A cell potential of less than half a volt corresponds to $K \approx 10^{15}$. At 298 K, **each 0.0592 V of $E^\circ_{cell}$ multiplies $K$ by ten per electron transferred**, so with $n = 2$ this 0.46 V is worth about 15.5 factors of ten. A voltage you could measure with a hardware-store multimeter pins down an equilibrium constant no titration could ever reach.

{{sp[warning] n is not optional}} Both formulas contain $n$. Using $n = 1$ here would halve $\Delta G^\circ$ and take the square root of $K$ — an error of eight orders of magnitude from a single dropped integer.

::: tab Q 18
{{sp[info] Objective 18.4a}} · *short answer* A galvanic cell has $E^\circ_{cell} = 0$. State what this implies for $\Delta G^\circ$ and $K$, and explain what such a cell would do if assembled.
:::
::: tab Answer
**From the two relationships**, both terms vanish together:

$$\Delta G^\circ = -nFE^\circ = -nF(0) = 0$$
$$\Delta G^\circ = -RT\ln K = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \ln K = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad K = 1$$

**What the cell would do: nothing, *if* assembled at standard conditions.** With every species at 1 M and 1 atm, $Q = 1 = K$, so the cell is already at equilibrium and no current flows.

**But it is not a useless cell.** Assemble it at any *other* set of concentrations and $Q \neq K$, so the Nernst equation gives $E = -\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q \neq 0$ and current does flow — until the concentrations drift to where $Q = 1$ again.

**This is exactly the concentration cell of §18.4.** A concentration cell has $E^\circ = 0$ by construction, because both half-cells are the same couple; its entire potential comes from the $Q$ term, and it dies when the two concentrations equalize.

**The distinction to keep straight, as in Chapter 17:** $E^\circ = 0$ is a fact about the *reaction* (it says $K = 1$). $E = 0$ is a fact about the *particular cell in front of you* (it says $Q = K$). Every cell reaches $E = 0$ eventually — that is what a flat battery is — but almost none has $E^\circ = 0$.

:::
::: tab Answer
Pb has the higher E° → cathode; Mg → anode. Overall: $\ce{Mg(s) + Pb^2+(aq) -> Mg^2+(aq) + Pb(s)}$, $n=2$.

$$E^\circ_{cell}=-0.13-(-2.37)=2.24\ \text{V} \qquad Q=\frac{[\ce{Mg^2+}]}{[\ce{Pb^2+}]}=\frac{0.0514}{0.0437}=1.18$$

{{sp[info] Objective 18.4b}} · *workout* For $\ce{Zn(s) + Cu^2+(aq) -> Zn^2+(aq) + Cu(s)}$, $E^\circ = 1.10$ V and $n = 2$. Find $E$ when $[\ce{Zn^2+}] = 0.0010$ M and $[\ce{Cu^2+}] = 2.0$ M.
:::
::: tab Answer
**Write $Q$**, omitting the two solids:

$$Q = \frac{[\ce{Zn^2+}]}{[\ce{Cu^2+}]} = \frac{0.0010}{2.0} = 5.0\times10^{-4}$$

**Apply the Nernst equation:**

$$E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q = 1.10 - \frac{(8.314)(298)}{2(96{,}485)}\ln(5.0\times10^{-4})$$
$$= 1.10 - (0.01284)(-7.601) = 1.10 + 0.098 = 1.20\ \text{V}$$

**The potential *rose* above standard, and it should have.** The reactant $\ce{Cu^2+}$ is at twice its standard concentration while the product $\ce{Zn^2+}$ is a thousandfold below — the cell is further from equilibrium than a standard cell, so it has more driving force.

**The sign rule, stated once:** $Q < 1$ makes $\ln Q$ negative, and subtracting a negative *raises* $E$. Reactant-rich means high voltage; product-rich means low.

**Using the base-10 form as a check.** At 298 K, $E = E^\circ - \frac{0.0592}{n}\log Q$:
$$E = 1.10 - \frac{0.0592}{2}\log(5.0\times10^{-4}) = 1.10 - (0.0296)(-3.301) = 1.10 + 0.098 = 1.20\ \text{V}$$

The two routes agree ✓

Note again how modest the shift is: a 2,000-fold swing in the concentration ratio moved the voltage by less than 0.1 V. **Cell potential is logarithmically — that is, weakly — sensitive to concentration.**

{{sp[info] Objective 18.4b}} · *short answer* A fresh AA battery reads 1.5 V and holds nearly that voltage for most of its life, then drops rapidly to zero near the end. Explain both behaviors using the Nernst equation.
:::
::: tab Answer
Both follow from $E = E^\circ - \frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q$, and specifically from the fact that $Q$ enters through a **logarithm**.

**Why the voltage stays flat.** As the cell discharges, reactants are consumed and products accumulate, so $Q$ rises. But at 298 K with $n = 2$ the whole correction term is only $0.0296\log Q$ volts — **a hundredfold change in $Q$ costs about 0.06 V.** Through most of the discharge $Q$ changes by a few orders of magnitude and the terminal voltage barely moves. A logarithm is an extremely effective flattener.

**Why it then collapses.** Near the end, one reactant is nearly exhausted, and its concentration appears in the *denominator* of $Q$. As that concentration approaches zero, $Q \to \infty$ and $\ln Q \to \infty$, so $E$ falls off a cliff. The final drop is fast for the same reason the earlier plateau was flat: the logarithm is nearly flat over most of its domain and vertical at the ends.

**The end point is exactly $E = 0$**, reached when $Q = K$. A dead battery is not one that has run out of material — it is one that has reached equilibrium.

**Why this is a design virtue.** Electronics need a stable supply voltage, and this logarithmic flatness delivers it for free. It is also why "battery percentage remaining" is hard to estimate from voltage alone: for most of the discharge the voltage carries almost no information about how much is left.

:::

This is a concentration cell ($E^\circ=0$): the dilute side (0.100 M) is the anode, the concentrated side (1.00 M) is the cathode. $n=2$, $Q=0.100/1.00=0.100$:

::: tab Q 23
{{sp[info] Objective 18.4c}} · *short answer* In a concentration cell, why is the more dilute half-cell always the anode?
:::
::: tab Answer
The cell spontaneously moves the system toward equal concentrations (Le Chatelier's principle, Chapter 14) — the concentrated side's ions are reduced and deposited as metal (cathode), while the dilute side's electrode continues to oxidize and dissolve, adding more ions to that already-dilute solution (anode). This is the direction that actually releases free energy.

{{sp[info] Objective 18.4c}} · *workout* A concentration cell uses copper electrodes in $\ce{Cu^2+}$ solutions of 0.0010 M and 0.50 M. (a) Identify the anode. (b) Calculate $E$. \(c) What happens to $E$ as the cell runs?
:::
::: tab Answer
**(a) The dilute half-cell (0.0010 M) is the anode.** The cell runs in whichever direction equalizes the two concentrations, so copper **dissolves** into the dilute side — that is oxidation. On the concentrated side copper **plates out**, which is reduction, making it the cathode.

**(b)** For a concentration cell $E^\circ = 0$, so the entire potential comes from $Q$. With $n = 2$:

$$Q = \frac{[\ce{Cu^2+}]_\text{anode}}{[\ce{Cu^2+}]_\text{cathode}} = \frac{0.0010}{0.50} = 2.0\times10^{-3}$$

$$E = -\frac{RT}{nF}\ln Q = -(0.01284)\ln(2.0\times10^{-3}) = -(0.01284)(-6.215) = 0.0798\ \text{V}$$

About **80 mV**.

**\(c) $E$ falls toward zero.** As the cell operates the dilute side becomes more concentrated and the concentrated side less so. When the two match, $Q = 1$, $\ln Q = 0$, and $E = 0$ — the cell is dead.

**What kills a concentration cell is different from what kills an ordinary one.** No reactant is consumed and no product accumulates; the same substance is on both sides throughout. The cell dies when the *difference* disappears. In thermodynamic terms (Chapter 17) it is running purely on the entropy of mixing, and it stops when the mixing is complete.

**Why 80 mV is a lot for this kind of cell.** A 500-fold concentration ratio buys only 0.08 V, which is useless as a power source — but it is why a concentration cell makes an excellent *sensor*: the voltage depends on nothing but the ratio.

:::
::: tab Answer
During normal use, the battery operates as a **galvanic cell**, discharging via its spontaneous redox reaction to supply current. Recharging runs that same reaction in reverse — a nonspontaneous process — by using external electrical energy from the outlet to force it forward, which is exactly **electrolysis**. The same cell alternates between acting as a galvanic cell (discharging) and an electrolytic cell (recharging).

(What does flip is the *sign* marked on the electrode. In a galvanic cell the anode is labeled negative; in an electrolytic cell the external supply makes it positive. The chemistry is unchanged; only the labelling convention differs, which is why keying your memory to "anode = oxidation" is safer than keying it to a sign.)

**The relationship between the two.** They are the same reaction in opposite directions. Discharging a rechargeable battery is galvanic; charging it is electrolytic, with a power supply forcing the reaction backwards. Electrolyzing water costs at least the energy that burning the hydrogen returns — **electrolysis stores energy, it does not create it.**

{{sp[info] Objective 18.5a}} · *short answer* Explain why rusting is an electrochemical process rather than a simple reaction with oxygen, and why iron rusts fastest at the waterline of a partly submerged object rather than fully underwater or fully dry.

::: tab Answer
**Why it is electrochemical.** Rusting is a galvanic cell operating on a single piece of metal, with the two half-reactions occurring at *different places* on the surface:

$$\text{Anode (a pit or scratch): } \ce{Fe(s) -> Fe^2+(aq) + 2e-}$$
$$\text{Cathode (elsewhere): } \ce{O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e- -> 2H2O(l)}$$

Electrons travel **through the metal itself** from anode to cathode; ions travel through the surface water film, which acts as the electrolyte. That is a complete cell — it simply has no wire, because the metal is the wire.

$$E^\circ_{cell} = 1.23 - (-0.44) = +1.67\ \text{V}$$

**Why the waterline is worst.** The process needs **three** things at once: iron, water (electrolyte), and oxygen.

- **Fully dry:** no electrolyte, so no ion transport and no circuit. Iron in dry desert air survives for centuries.
- **Fully submerged:** water in abundance, but dissolved $\ce{O2}$ is scarce (Chapter 12 — gas solubility is low, and falls further with depth and temperature). The cathode reaction is starved.
- **At the waterline:** water film *and* direct atmospheric oxygen, both plentiful. Every requirement is met simultaneously.

**The corollary that follows.** Rust does not just appear where water sits; it appears where water and air meet. This is why ships corrode at the waterline, why cars rust in wheel wells and door bottoms where water lingers but air still reaches, and why the fix is either to exclude water entirely (paint) or to supply a sacrificial anode.
